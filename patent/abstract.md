## Abstract
A system for falsifiable process evidence creates tamper‑evident records of content creation without relying on content detection or trusted certification. At session start, the system records a capture environment declaration and binds it to every checkpoint. Successive checkpoints are time‑locked with verifiable delay functions so they can’t be back‑dated without real elapsed time. Behavioral binding uses cryptographic keystroke timing (jitter seals) to tie real‑time activity to evolving document hashes without capturing keystroke content. Hardware binding can add PUF responses and/or TPM attestation quotes to prove device identity and prevent rollback. Each checkpoint is appended to a Merkle Mountain Range log, signed with a scoped session key, and ratcheted forward so past checkpoints remain safe after later compromise. Evidence is exportable as a portable packet containing inclusion proofs, timing proofs, and optional external anchors. The system enforces adversarial collapse by forcing challengers to allege a specific mechanism and window of fraud rather than vague claims of fabrication.

        "description": "Witnessd provides cryptographic authorship witnessing with keystroke biometrics. It creates tamper-evident proof of document creation timeline, helping writers, creators, and professionals establish authentic authorship evidence.\n\nKey Features:\n\n• Cryptographic Checkpoints: Create verifiable snapshots of your work at any time with VDF (Verifiable Delay Function) proofs that mathematically prove minimum elapsed time between commits.\n\n• Keystroke Biometrics: Non-invasive keystroke timing analysis creates unique behavioral fingerprints without capturing actual keystrokes. Your privacy is protected - only timing patterns are recorded.\n\n• Tamper-Evident Evidence: All evidence is cryptographically chained. Any modification to the chain is mathematically detectable.\n\n• Export & Verify: Generate evidence packets that can be independently verified by anyone, anywhere, without requiring special software.\n\n• Privacy-First Design: No cloud uploads required. All data stays on your device. No accounts needed.\n\nUse Cases:\n• Writers proving original authorship\n• Researchers documenting creation timeline\n• Creators establishing prior art\n• Professionals protecting intellectual property\n• Legal evidence of document provenance\n\nTechnical Excellence:\n• Built with Go for performance and reliability\n• Uses Ed25519 signatures for cryptographic proof\n• VDF proofs based on SHA-256 iteration chains\n• Optional TPM hardware binding for enhanced security\n• Open source and auditable\n\nPatent Pending: USPTO Application No. 19/460,364",

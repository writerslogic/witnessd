Description: Cryptographic authorship witnessing daemon
 Witnessd provides cryptographic authorship witnessing through kinetic
 proof of provenance. It captures keystroke dynamics and timing patterns
 to create unforgeable evidence of human authorship.
 .
 Features:
  - Merkle Mountain Range (MMR) append-only log
  - Ed25519 digital signatures
  - Privacy-preserving keystroke biometrics
  - Multi-anchor timestamping (blockchain, Keybase, etc.)
  - Forensic analysis toolkit

Package: witnessd-ibus
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, witnessd (= ${binary:Version}), ibus (>= 1.5)
Description: IBus integration for witnessd
 IBus input method engine for witnessd that captures keystroke dynamics
 through the Linux input method framework.
 .
 This package provides system-wide keystroke witnessing through IBus
 without requiring elevated privileges.

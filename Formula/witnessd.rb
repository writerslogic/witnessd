      To get started with witnessd:

        1. Initialize witnessd:
           witnessd init

        2. Calibrate VDF for your machine:
           witnessd calibrate

        3. Create your first checkpoint:
           witnessd commit your-document.md -m "Initial draft"

      For documentation:
        man witnessd
        man witnessctl

      Privacy note: Keystroke tracking counts keystrokes only.
      It does NOT capture which keys are pressed.
